# Overview
This is a simple game based off of "Flappy Bird."

I built this app to get more familiar with Flutter, as well as mobile development in general.

# Development Environment

This program was made entirely in flutter, using a Pixel 7 emulator from Android studio for testing.
I utilized "Flame" which is a game engine designed specifically for Flutter.

# Useful Websites

* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)

# Future Work
* Make the main menu look similar to the actual game, with working parallax.
* Add sound effects.
* Add a lifetime high score variable that can save and carry over.
